# prosh

prosh is a shell that supports user productivity by preventing users from getting distracted.

## Installation

Be sure to have both executables: prosh and proshdom. Furthermore, they need to be inside the same directory.
Afterwards, you can run prosh ('./prosh') and use the 'help' command to get yourself started.

## Productivity Mode

Start the productivity mode with 'prod start'.
End the productivity mode with 'prod end'.

## Important Note

For the sake of your etc/hosts file, please end the productivity mode before terminating prosh.
